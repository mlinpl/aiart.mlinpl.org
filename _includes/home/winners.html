                By exploring the spaces within the VR 6DoF experience, the participant gains access to digital tools that enable the expansion of senses. The synesthetic language of simulation provides the immersed individual with the opportunity to discover content generated by artificial intelligence models. The simulation of thoughts, speech, and emotions, as well as the self-awareness of technology and the mechanisms constructing it, undergo self-analysis by the system itself. This allows the experiencer to gain insight into the digital world, creating a portal to the brain and heart of algorithmic structure.

            <h3>/ 2nd prize - <strong>Manifesto</strong> by Zuzanna Wudarska</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-8">
            <p>
                Manifesto Against the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Art is a work written with ChatGPT and performed by ElevenLabs, based on samples of the artist's voice. It embodies the very duality it protests. Its paradoxical tone reveals both curiosity and fear—yet its delivery is itself a product of AI, challenging the authenticity of its own message.

                Japanese composer, sound and multimedia artist based in Berlin, known for creating innovative, tech-integrated compositions that he calls "Gesamtkunstwerk." After completing studies in composition at Tokyo College of Music (2003-2009) and the Academy of Music "Hanns Eisler" in Berlin (2009-2013), he has continued pushing the boundaries of music with works that blend classical music and cutting-edge technology. His opera Vitruvian, performed in Berlin and London, showcases this approach by merging traditional and digital elements.

                His primary artistic focus, "TRANS-AGES MUSIC," seeks to reveal the universe's inherent structure through sound, exploring the intersection between human perception and the "geometric structure" of music. Since 2016, he has pioneered "Hyper Serial Music," algorithmic compositions that integrate AI to expand on Serialism principles, performed across 70 cities. His notable works include Face of Universe, which debuted at Seoul’s Zerone Festival and was recently shown at CIKE, ISEA, Madatac, and Share Festival. Other recent performances include Re-Solarization at the Berlin Philharmonic Hall, Nemo Biennale in Paris, and Sonica in Glasgow.
