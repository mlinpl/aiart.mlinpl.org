- title: "Will it Blend? The Future of Human/AI Collaboration in Creativity"
  abstract: >-
    Many studies have concluded that AI is in no way inferior to humans in terms of creativity. Unfortunately, these studies do not define what they mean by creativity. Boris shows the complexity of the creative collaboration between humans and AI – and the impact it will have on the role of artists. He will show which creativity theories will help us to better understand and sensibly divide up the collaboration between humans and AI in the future.

    Boris Eldagsen (*1970, photo by Jan Sobottka) studied fine arts as well as philosophy. As a photomedia artist, he has exhibited since 2000 in various institutions and festivals including Fridericianum Kassel, ACP Sydney and Singapore International Photography Festival. Since 2004 he has been teaching as a lecturer and visiting professor at international art schools and gives workshops for the Goethe Institute, festivals and museums. Boris has been an appointed member of the German Photographic Academy (DFA) since 2013 and a member of the DGPh since 2023. He is a digital advisor to Roger Ballen and was "Head of Digital" at the DFA from 2016 to 2023, for which he designed and managed numerous online formats on artistic photography. He is also a founding member of the "Technological Progress" working group of the German Photo Council, in which Germany's photography associations discuss the impact of AI on photography. In April 2023, he turned down the Sony World Photography Award (Open Category / Creative) because he had applied with an AI-generated image to test whether photography competitions and a debate on the relationship between AI-generated images and photography were possible. His stunt became worldwide news and his image PSEUDOMNESIA | The Electrician became one of the most famous of the year.
