    The project is an interactive virtual experience that references video games such as “maze” and “fighting game”. The person playing the role of orant moves through a virtual labyrinth, meeting mythical animals that absorb their own genesis and dream animals that materialize in our unconscious. At the end of the game, the recipient becomes part of the eternal dispute between the Priest of Species Extinction and the Antihuman.

    Work explores themes of biodiversity, humanity’s expansive relationship with nature, and the role of AI in the conflict between nature and culture. The work also addresses the role of machine learning in creating new myths and reinterpreting existing ones. In this anti-human dystopia, AI becomes a divine creation through which the timeless rite of passage can continue.

    By exploring the spaces within the VR 6DoF experience, the participant gains access to digital tools that enable the expansion of senses. The synesthetic language of simulation provides the immersed individual with the opportunity to discover content generated by artificial intelligence models. The simulation of thoughts, speech, and emotions, as well as the self-awareness of technology and the mechanisms constructing it, undergo self-analysis by the system itself. This allows the experiencer to gain insight into the digital world, creating a portal to the brain and heart of algorithmic structure.

    In the project Acts of Data: Stones, I investigate the speculative nature of computers generating—via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)— new potential historical artefacts created through image synthesis of pre-existing publicly available datasets of 3D models. Within this framework, I used the dataset provided by the “Scan the World” initiative, a repository that hosts scanned 3D models of historical statues from some of the world’s most prominent museums. 
    <br>
    With utilizing the rich resources of the “Scan the World” dataset, my project goes beyond the mere generation of 3D models. It critically examines the historical bias inherent in archiving and presenting artistic works. This endeavor aligns perfectly with the ethos of questioning and redefining museological approaches and practices. By utilizing the extensive collection of scanned historical objects, I explored how the algorithmic creations of the application reflect upon and potentially challenge the gender spectrum and cultural symbolisms embedded within these artifacts. 
    <br>
    One of the focal points of my exploration within the ‘Stones’ project is to investigate the historical context of statues and sculptures, which have often been representative of societal norms, power dynamics, and cultural values. I am intrigued by the prospect of observing how the algorithm’s creations interact with these contexts and how they might challenge or reinforce prevailing narratives. By generating new forms that may not have existed in reality, I aim to provoke discussions on alternative histories and perspectives, encouraging viewers to contemplate the biases and assumptions that shape our understanding of art and history.

    In the work “L’Amour Toujours,” I explore hidden, quiet spaces of everyday life, such as cables and routers tucked behind furniture, which I personify and intertwine into abstract, technological relationships. Referring to passive forms of resistance, such as the Tang Ping movement, I am interested in failures, transformations, and omissions that allow for the construction of alternative lives on the margins of error. The video, based on AI and recorded scenes, presents a looped world of imagined, overlooked spaces, blending human and technological sensibilities.

    Multidisciplinary artist. Graduate of the Faculty of Intermedia at the Academy of Fine Arts in Cracow, currently a student at the Faculty of New Media at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. In his art practice, he is most interested in the interdependence and mutual permeation of the physical and virtual worlds. He reflects on identity and unity in the context of the existence of virtual and mechanical bodies. He analyzes the current situation in the world, with a particular focus on dystopian references, and reflects on personal freedom in a world where the boundaries between reality and virtuality are becoming more and more blurred.

    The item was designed as a “protector” for the hand and forearm. The “sampling” aspect of reality is important, the organic form of the shell, which has protected organisms for millions of years, has been “redesigned” and produced in a digital way along with artifacts (pixel texture occurring). The title shell alludes to the masterpiece Ghost in the Shell—also asking the question about the dystopian future of humanity and our planet in an era of increasing digitalization and climate disasters, where we are awakened daily by notifications of discoveries previously known only from cyberpunk cultural works. Can the technologies we see as innovative today contribute in the future to solving the problems they themselves co-create?
    <br>
    「SHELL」invites reflection on the boundaries between the natural and the artificial, and it further explores the uncertainties surrounding artificial intelligence. As we increasingly rely on AI to recreate existing forms and mimic nature, where do we draw the line between what is real and what is an imitation? In this process, are we losing something essential? What happens when the artificial begins to simulate life so convincingly that it becomes indistinguishable from the original? In a world where AI may be trusted to innovate, could it also be guilty of perpetuating illusions, blurring the authenticity of natural designs with digital recreations?

    As the course is set, the work forks off clustered timelines at the exact moment when activist Carlo Giuliani was shot dead at the G8 anti-globalization protests in Genoa (2001-07-20/17:27h). This crucial event triggered a pandemic of passivity, crashed reality, artificial imaginations, and spaghettification.

    Manifesto Against the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Art is a work written with ChatGPT and performed by ElevenLabs, based on samples of the artist's voice. It embodies the very duality it protests. Its paradoxical tone reveals both curiosity and fear—yet its delivery is itself a product of AI, challenging the authenticity of its own message.
    <br>
    Zuzanna Wudarska (she/her) - born in 2001, is an audiovisual artist based in Warsaw, Poland. Currently a 4th-year student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, majoring in Media Arts. She was awarded the Rector's Scholarship three times, and her BA diploma earned the Dean’s Award and was voted the best diploma by students. In her work, she primarily uses photography, video, and sound to explore themes of discomfort and everyday life. She is a part of the collective "Zdjęcia do dokumentów," which supports people in refugee crises. Her works have been presented at numerous group exhibitions in Warsaw, Poznań, Katowice, Kraków, Łódź and Nottingham.
