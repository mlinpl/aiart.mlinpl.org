#     By exploring the spaces within the VR 6DoF experience, the participant gains access to digital tools that enable the expansion of senses. The synesthetic language of simulation provides the immersed individual with the opportunity to discover content generated by artificial intelligence models. The simulation of thoughts, speech, and emotions, as well as the self-awareness of technology and the mechanisms constructing it, undergo self-analysis by the system itself. This allows the experiencer to gain insight into the digital world, creating a portal to the brain and heart of algorithmic structure.

    In the project Acts of Data: Stones, I investigate the speculative nature of computers generating—via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)— new potential historical artefacts created through image synthesis of pre-existing publicly available datasets of 3D models. Within this framework, I used the dataset provided by the “Scan the World” initiative, a repository that hosts scanned 3D models of historical statues from some of the world’s most prominent museums. 

    With utilizing the rich resources of the “Scan the World” dataset, my project goes beyond the mere generation of 3D models. It critically examines the historical bias inherent in archiving and presenting artistic works. This endeavor aligns perfectly with the ethos of questioning and redefining museological approaches and practices. By utilizing the extensive collection of scanned historical objects, I explored how the algorithmic creations of the application reflect upon and potentially challenge the gender spectrum and cultural symbolisms embedded within these artifacts. 

    One of the focal points of my exploration within the ‘Stones’ project is to investigate the historical context of statues and sculptures, which have often been representative of societal norms, power dynamics, and cultural values. I am intrigued by the prospect of observing how the algorithm’s creations interact with these contexts and how they might challenge or reinforce prevailing narratives. By generating new forms that may not have existed in reality, I aim to provoke discussions on alternative histories and perspectives, encouraging viewers to contemplate the biases and assumptions that shape our understanding of art and history.

    In the work “L’Amour Toujours,” I explore hidden, quiet spaces of everyday life, such as cables and routers tucked behind furniture, which I personify and intertwine into abstract, technological relationships. Referring to passive forms of resistance, such as the Tang Ping movement, I am interested in failures, transformations, and omissions that allow for the construction of alternative lives on the margins of error. The video, based on AI and recorded scenes, presents a looped world of imagined, overlooked spaces, blending human and technological sensibilities.

    With 'The Silver Singularity', commissioned for the 2024 Busan Biennale, UBERMORGEN hack reality through alternate timelines, and unleash 'Happy Dystopias' into our Neo-Biedermeier age. In der Ruhe liegt die Kraft: unlocking hidden potentials and perspectives. Creak.

    As the course is set, the work forks off clustered timelines at the exact moment when activist Carlo Giuliani was shot dead at the G8 anti-globalization protests in Genoa (2001-07-20/17:27h). This crucial event triggered a pandemic of passivity, crashed reality, artificial imaginations, and spaghettification.

    Manifesto Against the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Art is a work written with ChatGPT and performed by ElevenLabs, based on samples of the artist's voice. It embodies the very duality it protests. Its paradoxical tone reveals both curiosity and fear—yet its delivery is itself a product of AI, challenging the authenticity of its own message.

    Zuzanna Wudarska (she/her) - born in 2001, is an audiovisual artist based in Warsaw, Poland. Currently a 4th-year student at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, majoring in Media Arts. She was awarded the Rector's Scholarship three times, and her BA diploma earned the Dean’s Award and was voted the best diploma by students. In her work, she primarily uses photography, video, and sound to explore themes of discomfort and everyday life. She is a part of the collective "Zdjęcia do dokumentów," which supports people in refugee crises. Her works have been presented at numerous group exhibitions in Warsaw, Poznań, Katowice, Kraków, Łódź and Nottingham.
