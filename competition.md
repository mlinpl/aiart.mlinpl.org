## / Future Will Be Better Tommorow

We are excited to invite all artists and AI enthusiasts to our AI Art Competition and Exposition, titled "The Future Will Be Better Tomorrow." This competition aims to showcase how AI models can be powerful tools in the artistic process and to explore your perspectives on the future of AI.

The competition consists of the following phases:
- Online submission of your work, accompanied by a detailed description
- Notification of the top 30 works invited to present at the on-site exposition
- Official opening of the exposition and final grading process
- Official awards ceremony, with cash prizes

The main organizer of the competition is ML in PL Association, with the Museum of Modern Arts, and TODO as co-organizers.

Learn more about the Competition below, and **submit your work here:**

## / Introduction

Most economists assume that technology, like GDP, grows by a fixed yearly percentage, say 2% per year. It has been suggested, however, that at least in the realm of IT and computer science, technological progress is better described as hyperbolic,[1] potentially reaching infinity ("exploding") in finite time. Due in large part to astonishing advancements made in the realm of artificial intelligence in the past two years, this notion of hyperbolic technology growth is now a topic of wide discussion.[2] 

While not necessarily agreeing with this idea, we acknowledge the accumulating evidence for it. A key part of the notion of explosive growth (also seen in the analysis of climate change and its effects) is that as the explosion approaches, the world becomes progressively weirder and less predictable.

Accordingly, a significant breakthrough occurred with the development of large language models. These models demonstrated an unprecedented ability of solving problems and performing tasks that they were not explicitly programmed to do, just by learning from the texts on the internet [3]. This breakthrough has led to an important realisation: exposing AI models to a broader spectrum of knowledge and allowing them to perceive the world in a more holistic manner significantly enhances their capabilities. These models become smarter, better at solving new problems, and develop a better understanding of human contexts and nuances. It appears that the constraints of structured data, such as tables and labelled samples, limit the potential of AI models [4]. In contrast, allowing them to explore and perceive our world more freely fosters reasoning abilities, allows for creative behaviours, and a sense of understanding our human world. For instance, research on robotics has led to increased exploration of the world, including more and more 3D data collection.

“What is it like to be a bat?” is a question asked by American philosopher Thomas Nagel in 1974. He argued that for humans it is impossible to conceive the animal world, but this statement was made before the rapid development of AI. “You and I could never echolocate like a bat, trumpet like an elephant, buzz like a bee. But our computers can.”, said Karen Bakker, the author of The Sounds of Life. In the previous year, the first-ever foundation model for animal vocalisations and the first-ever datasets for animal vocalisations and movement were launched. Similar to the Turing test, the Dolittle test was developed to establish specific benchmarks for successful communication across species.

Not only has the data structure changed, but also the methods. Video generation was considered an excellent field to start research into advanced machine intelligence (AMI). V-JEPA uses contrastive learning to enhance the abstract "thinking" capabilities of AI models. Also, the key ability to detect patterns in data is increasing. The was recently developed a model that can automatically detect and classify patterns in datasets.

The pace of development is astonishing. In the past few months, the field of video generation has been conquered by SORA, which has opened up previously unimaginable opportunities for the cinema. Also, it is predicted that with the development of AI, films will become more game-like, with the viewer able to decide for the characters. Now, previously intractable problems can be overcome through the fusion of quantum computing and machine learning.

Faced with the difficulty of pre-planning and mounting an exhibit of AI art, a field that is likely to significantly change in the few months from concept to realisation, we have decided to announce an open call for innovative visual works in the realm of artificial intelligence and digital art. Specifically, we want to explore the futuristic (but realistic) visions, risks, and opportunities of development of AI models. For convenience, we provide an example list of problems in this area, but we hope that participants will surprise us. The winners will be awarded with monetary prizes and their works will be exhibited at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw.

The title of this exhibition comes from a 1991 speech by Dan Quayle, Vice-President of the United States under George H. W. Bush. In the 1990s, Quayle was frequently a topic of discussion in American media and everyday conversation for his uncanny, AI-like grammatical errors and misspellings.

## / Admission criteria

We accept only visual artworks, no music nor texts. Except for that, we have no specific rules regarding the form of artworks, as they may include images, videos, sculptures, installations and even live performances, as long as they touch the problem of the future of AI. We anticipate that AI will have been used in some way to create artworks, but we can also consider promising submissions that use only conventional methods. For more details and rules of admission, please refer to the Competition Terms and Conditions.

## / Judging criteria

- **Relevance**: Submitted artworks should reflect on the topic of the future of AI, and its future impact on our world. Example questions in this area can be found below.
- **Originality and creativity**: We highly value submissions that offer a unique, convincing and original perspective on the topic.
Integration of AI in the creative process: Submitted artworks should utilise AI techniques in the process of artwork creation.
- **Artistic and technical execution**: We value artworks with high artistic value and attention to detail.
- **Documentation and presentation**: Each work should include clear documentation explaining the concept, creation process, and AI’s role, aiding audience and jury understanding.

All accepted talks and posters will be presented during the Main Conference (or the Student Research Workshop). 
**The presenting author (the one submitting the application) will receive a free ticket.** 
The co-authors of accepted papers will have a guaranteed option to buy the tickets with the Early Bird prices.
