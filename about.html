                MSN collaborates with diverse groups and communities, as well as institutions in Poland
                and around the world. It is a space for dialogue where cognitive and aesthetic sensibilities
                are being shaped. It develops along with the City of Warsaw, it is meant to react to real-time events,
                and arouse curiosity in visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                The daily functioning of the Museum is driven by efforts to act ethically and

                The Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw is the largest and oldest institution of higher education
                for arts in Poland. It educates an average of 1600 students annually at nine Faculties based in
                four historical locations in Warsaw. Professor Błażej Ostoja Lniski is the Rector
                of the University for the 2020-2024 term.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw is the heir of over 250 years of tradition of artistic education,
                which it passes on to the next generations of young artists. It cultivates the traditions and values
                of Polish art, placing particular emphasis on openness, freedom of artistic exploration and scientific
                research, and respect for various creative attitudes. Studies at the Academy of Fine Arts in
                Warsaw provide an extraordinary opportunity to develop individual passions and shape an artistic
                path under the supervision of excellent academic staff – leading artists and researchers.

                ML in PL Association is a non-profit organization set up by students from Poland that wanted to have 
                a world-class machine learning conference in their country, so they decided to organize it themselves.
                The association consists of a group of volunteers, mostly undergrad, graduate, and PhD students, 
                that are devoted to fostering the machine learning community in Poland and Europe 
                and promoting a deep understanding of machine learning.

                Despite the conference being organized by volunteers in their free time, 
                the years of experience, well-defined structure of the management,
                and knowledge transfer between senior and junior members of the association
                ensure mostly smooth organization of a large-scale international event, which is {{ page.mlinpl-inline-logo }}.

                <!-- 100% of the profits from the conference are used to support the organization of the next editions of ML in PL Conference and our Machine Learning Summer Schools. -->
