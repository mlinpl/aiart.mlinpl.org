                ML in PL Association is a non-profit organization set up by students from Poland that wanted to have 
                a world-class machine learning conference in their country, so they decided to organize it themselves.
                The association consists of a group of volunteers, mostly undergrad, graduate, and PhD students, 
                that are devoted to fostering the machine learning community in Poland and Europe 
                and promoting a deep understanding of machine learning.

                Despite the conference being organized by volunteers in their free time, 
                the years of experience, well-defined structure of the management,
                and knowledge transfer between senior and junior members of the association
                ensure mostly smooth organization of a large-scale international event, which is {{ page.mlinpl-inline-logo }}.
            </p>
            <p>
                100% of the profits from the conference are used to support the organization of the next editions of ML in PL Conference and our Machine Learning Summer Schools.
