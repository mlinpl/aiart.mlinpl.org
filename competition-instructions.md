In the application form for our Competition, we ask you to provide instructions for exhibiting your work. To allow you to decide which information might be useful to include, we will provide context by briefly describing the exhibition venue. More information on the available venue, including photos and floor plan sketches, will be provided within two weeks.

The venue that we have prepared for this exhibition is the building of the Faculty of Artistic Research at Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts ([official website in Polish](https://asp.waw.pl/kontakt/budynki/wybrzeze-kosciuszkowskie/)), located at Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie 37/39, overlooking the Vistula River. The exhibition will occupy two distinct spaces, joined by a spiral staircase and a wheelchair-accessible elevator. 

The first area, located on level -1, is about 250 000 sqm of gallery space. This area has roughly the structure of a central hub, ordinarily serving as an adaptable open-floor office area for classroom and conference purposes, with many smaller areas and corners projecting outwards. Although there are floor-to-ceiling windows on the entirety of the southern boundary of this area, its natural lighting is nonetheless quite dim, as the windows open under a see-through walkable platform that forms the building’s (external) main hall.

The second area available is located at a mezzanine on level 2 and is about 250 000 sqm of gallery space. In addition to continuous wall floor-to-ceiling windows on the area’s southern boundary, which overlooks the building’s main hall, it is also brightly lit from the east during daytime, with a clear glass facade enabling a somewhat spectacular view of the Vistula River coast. It is able to accommodate several large-scale works.

In addition, we may also make use of smaller areas throughout the building, including the entrance hall, the exterior main hall, or the staircase.

Crucially, our gallery space is not divided into multiple small areas. Your work will most likely be exhibited not in a traditional room, but in a varied open area of irregular shape. This might enable placement of your work that is more specific to it than is typically possible. We therefore encourage you to specify how your work makes use of space, and what spatial environment would, in your view, allow it to be displayed to the greatest artistic effect.

Please keep in mind that while our exhibition space is extensive and permits us to adequately display multiple large-scale works, it might nonetheless happen that we will be unable to provide a venue for all of the submitted works that we would wish to exhibit. Should that be the case for your work, it will be our highest priority to get back to you at the earliest possible date, and discuss any adjustments that can be made.
