## Details about Submission Format
**(1st stage of the Competition: for the submission of works)**

To qualify for the first stage of the Competition (Call for Contribution stage) you will be asked to prepare a digital submission of your work in the submission form. 

The digital submission is a link to a Google Drive folder, which is expected to contain min. 3 files:
- Video: Max 3 minutes, presenting and explaining the Project. This video will be displayed during the awards ceremony at the Exhibition in case of winning.
- Concept Document: Text document explaining the concept / idea behind the Project and how it’s related to the topic of the Competition (min. 100 words).
- Project Documentation: Documentation of the Project creation process and specifications of how to run / display the artwork. This may include: text document describing the process, gallery of in-progress photos, link to code repository. This document should also describe any special / additional requirements of showing the Project

The Project submission does not have to be finished at the time of submission, and can be constantly updated. After the submission deadline passes, the project files will be downloaded by Organizer and used to determine if the work qualifies for the exhibition and next stage of competition. Changes made after the submission deadline will not be considered in making the decision.

## Details about the Venue
**(2nd stage of the Competition: for works accepted for the Exhibition)**

After you pass the 1st stage of the Competition, you will be invited to present your work in person at the venue. In the application form for our Competition, we ask you to provide instructions for exhibiting your work. To allow you to decide which information might be useful to include, we will provide context by briefly describing the exhibition venue. More information on the available venue, including photos and floor plan sketches, will be provided soon.

The venue that we have prepared for this exhibition is the building of the Faculty of Artistic Research at Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts ([official website in Polish](https://asp.waw.pl/kontakt/budynki/wybrzeze-kosciuszkowskie/)), located at Wybrzeże Kościuszkowskie 37/39, overlooking the Vistula River. The exhibition will occupy two distinct spaces, joined by a spiral staircase and a wheelchair-accessible elevator. 

The first area, located on level -1, is about 250 000 sqm of gallery space. This area has roughly the structure of a central hub, ordinarily serving as an adaptable open-floor office area for classroom and conference purposes, with many smaller areas and corners projecting outwards. Although there are floor-to-ceiling windows on the entirety of the southern boundary of this area, its natural lighting is nonetheless quite dim, as the windows open under a see-through walkable platform that forms the building’s (external) main hall.

The second area available is located at a mezzanine on level 2 and is about 250 000 sqm of gallery space. In addition to continuous wall floor-to-ceiling windows on the area’s southern boundary, which overlooks the building’s main hall, it is also brightly lit from the east during daytime, with a clear glass facade enabling a somewhat spectacular view of the Vistula River coast. It is able to accommodate several large-scale works.

In addition, we may also make use of smaller areas throughout the building, including the entrance hall, the exterior main hall, or the staircase.

Crucially, our gallery space is not divided into multiple small areas. Your work will most likely be exhibited not in a traditional room, but in a varied open area of irregular shape. This might enable placement of your work that is more specific to it than is typically possible. We therefore encourage you to specify how your work makes use of space, and what spatial environment would, in your view, allow it to be displayed to the greatest artistic effect.

Please keep in mind that while our exhibition space is extensive and permits us to adequately display multiple large-scale works, it might nonetheless happen that we will be unable to provide a venue for all of the submitted works that we would wish to exhibit. Should that be the case for your work, it will be our highest priority to get back to you at the earliest possible date, and discuss any adjustments that can be made.
